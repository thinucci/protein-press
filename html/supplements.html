			<div id="sup-1" class="content first col-12 row">
				<img class="first col-6" src="../images/supplements/whey_isolate.png" alt="Whey Protein">
				<p class="first col-6">Whey protein is a liquid byproduct of cheese production that is sold as a dietary supplement in protein powders and shakes. Whey protein used to be discarded by cheese manufacturers as a waste product. There are various qualities people will look for when purchasing a whey protein supplement, which range from purity, to digestibility, to whether or not it’s from an organic source, to quite simply the taste of the protein itself. The key characteristics of the whey protein supplement is that it contains a high amount of protein, very little to no artificial sweeteners and/or hormones, all the beneficial components of the immunoglobulins, minimization of lactose, while being somewhat palatable.
				With all of those factors taken into consideration, whey protein isolate turns to being your top pick, as it meets all the criteria. Whey Protein Isolate has high amounts of protein, while minimizing the amount of lactose (found more in WPC). WPI is easily digested and if cold-filtered can contain most of the immunoglobulins, which the whey protein hydrolysate is typically lacking due to the extreme processing it goes through. Also, although WPC may taste a bit better, whey protein hydrolysate is not very palatable, whereas you can find WPI brands with minimal artificial sweeteners that still tastes good.<br><br>

			<div class="toggle shadow"><h2>Creatine</h2></div>
			<div id="sup-2" class="content first col-12 row">
				<img class="first col-6" src="../images/supplements/creatine.jpg" alt="Creatine">
				<p class="first col-6">Creatine is an organic acid that plays a key role in supplying energy for muscle cells during intense activity.
				Creatine is produced naturally by the body and found in small quantities in animal products. Creatine stored in muscle cells helps produce ATP, which is the primary energy currency in the body.
				While creatine is not an essential nutrient because the body can synthesize it, it’s one of the most widely used supplements because there is strong evidence it can improve performance and is safe for most people. Additionally, creatine may have other health-promoting properties beyond its ability to make a person stronger or faster. Benefits include: <br>1) Increase in muscle size – Creatine supplementation causes an increase in the water content of muscles, making them “larger.” This is not due to an increase in the size of the muscle fibers. However, creatine can increase “real” fat free mass over time, as its strength and power-boosting properties allow higher quality training and thus, better gains.1
				<br>2) Improved athletic performance – A large body of research shows that oral creatine supplementation can make an athlete faster and stronger when performing high intensity activity.
				<br>3) Increased muscle protein synthesis – I found a few studies which refuted this claim. Still, if someone who uses creatine can lift more weight, muscle protein synthesis should increase; although, the creatine itself simply increases the available energy supply (ATP) for muscle contraction. Creatine itself does not stimulate protein synthesis. 
				Remember, there has never been a scientifically controlled study showing that jumping out of an airplane with a parachute is any better than jumping out without one.<br><br>

			<div id="sup-3" class="content first col-12 row">
				<img class="first col-6" src="../images/supplements/bcaa.jpg" alt="BCAA">
				<p class="first col-6">As the building blocks of protein, amino acids are necessary for the growth and repair of muscles and tissues. Without them, protein in the body breaks down, resulting in muscle loss. There are 20 total amino acids the body needs. About half are non-essential, meaning they’re made by the body; the other half are essential, meaning they must be obtained from food or supplements. 
				Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), named according to their molecular structure, include the essential amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine, and can be taken in supplement form before, during or after a workout to help improve exercise performance and endurance in addition to potentially aiding in muscle recovery. (Always consult your doctor before taking them, though.)
				Amino acids from food travel first to the liver, where they’re broken down for use as fuel or assigned to muscle repair. BCAAs bypass the liver and go directly to the muscles for fueling, building and repairing. Thus, they can be used during a workout for endurance and after for muscle-building.<br><br>

			<div class="toggle shadow"><h2>Glutamine</h2></div>
			<div id="sup-4" class="content first col-12 row">
				<img class="first col-6" src="../images/supplements/glutamine.jpg" alt="Glutamine">
				<p class="first col-6">Glutamine plays key roles in protein metabolism, cell volumizing, and anti-catabolism. Glutamine also increases your ability to secrete Human Growth Hormone, which helps metabolize body fat and support new muscle growth. Glutamine's anti-catabolism ability prevents the breakdown of your muscles.
				This is especially useful for people 'cutting down'. Especially during summer when you're trying to get rid of some body fat without losing any muscle. Glutamine is needed throughout your body for optimal performance. Your small intestines requires the most Glutamine in your body, and your immune system also needs Glutamine because Glutamine levels deplete during workouts, bodybuilders are more susceptible to illnesses - this is why L-Glutamine supplementation is so important, not necessarily to gain more muscle, but for the 'maintenance' effects of L-Glutamine.<br><br>

			<div class="toggle shadow"><h2>Nitric Oxide</h2></div>
			<div id="sup-5" class="content first col-12 row">
				<img class="first col-6" src="../images/supplements/no2.jpg" alt="Nitric Oxide">
				<p class="first col-6">Increasing nitric oxide has become the new secret weapon for athletes and bodybuilders. Athletes are now taking supplements with L-arginine and L-citrulline to support the flow of blood and oxygen to the skeletal muscle. They also use them to facilitate the removal of exercise-induced lactic acid build-up which reduces fatigue and recovery time. Since arginine levels become depleted during exercise, the entire arginine-nitric oxide - citrulline loop can lose efficiency, causing less-than-ideal nitric oxide levels and higher lactate levels. Supplements can help restore this loop allowing for better workouts and faster recovery from workouts.
				With nitric oxide deficiencies due to aging, inactivity, smoking, high cholesterol, fatty diets, and lack of healthy foods, increasing your nitric oxide levels can help increase your energy, vitality and overall wellness. The basic adage of eating well and staying active all makes sense now.
				WARNING: If you have an existing heart condition or abnormal blood pressure, please consult your healthcare professional before taking supplements to increase nitric oxide levels.<br><br>

			<div class="toggle shadow"><h2>ZMA</h2></div>
			<div id="sup-6" class="content first col-12 row">
				<img class="first col-6" src="../images/supplements/zma.jpg" alt="ZMA">
				<p class="first col-6">ZMA is a precise combination of Zinc and Magnesium. Zinc is involved in many metabolic reactions. "Athletes have been reported to have lower levels of zinc and magnesium possibly due to increased sweating or inadequate intake in diet," explains Broschart. "But zinc deficiencies may impair immune function and decrease performance." Zinc also plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and cell growth. Testosterone levels fall without adequate zinc and has a correlation with liver function.
				Similarly, magnesium is involved in more than 300 metabolic reactions. It is essential for bone strength, a strong immune system, muscle contractions and a healthy nervous system. Magnesium deficiency is a key cause of poor sleep and can also lead to insulin insensitivity.
				Vitamin B6 helps the body convert protein into energy. Some research has shown that it works with folic acid and B12 to reduce levels of certain amino acids in the blood, which helps to reduce the risk of heart attack.<br><br>
