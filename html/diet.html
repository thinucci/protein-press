				<p class="col-6"><b>Ingredients:</b> 300g of sweet potatoes, 200g of lean chicken breast, tomatoes, onion and garlic powder.<br><br><b>How to:</b><br>Wrap the sweet potatoes with a paper towel or a thin plastic bag (plain, transparent, with no logos on it to avoid transfering that to the food while cooking). With a knife or fork, make small holes in the potatoes. Wrapped, put them in the microwave on high for 5 to 6 minutes. While it is cooking, preheat a shallow pan with a little bit of olive oil. Separate your chicken breasts, cut unwanted fats with a knife. Beat the meat with the back of the knife while being careful not to rip it in two. When the oil is hot, place the chicken in there. Cook it throughout until tender. Place sliced tomatoes and onion in the same pan. Garlic powder or pepper to taste. By the time the chicken is cooked you will have soft and nutritious sweet potatoes waiting for you in the microwave. Enjoy!</p>
